# ChatBot
A Chatbot is software that simulates human-like conversations with users via text messages on chat. Its key task is to help users by providing answers to their questions.
ChatBot is built on artificial intelligence(AI) technologies, including deep learning, natural language processing and machine learning (ML) algorithms, and require massive amounts of data. The more an end user interacts with the bot, the better voice recognition becomes at predicting an appropriate response.
Service organizations surveyed by Salesforce in 2020, 43% were already using AI bots while 57% claimed to do so in the next 18 months indicating 136% projected growth!
